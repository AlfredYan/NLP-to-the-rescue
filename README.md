# NLP-to-the-rescue
DePaul Capstone Project

You have been hired by an aspiring navigation app company to determine what features are required to become a leader in the navigation app space.  You are provided 6 months of Apple AppStore and Google Play Store reviews from all over the world.  Your goal is to use NLP techniques to build a model that can predict the topics associated with each reviews.  You'll start with simple bag of words techniques to gain some insight and then proceed to build an advanced classifier to represent the review topics and compare across different navigation apps.  Along the way you'll have to run translation and overcome some not so friendly emoji's that interfere ( or help?) your topic models.  Not all topics are equally represented so you may also face some issues around class imbalance when building your classifier.
